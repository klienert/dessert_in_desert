# dessert_in_desert

This was a simple project to introduce students to HTML/CSS and JavaScript. This was from CS400 at UW-Madison in the Fall 2020.

This program utilizes Math.Random to randomize the locations of 8 buttons.
Clicking on the 'Dessert' button increases the score while clicking on any of the 'Desert' buttons decreases the score.
